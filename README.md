# AGENTS.md Templates

This repository contains templates for `AGENTS.md` files, which serve as context and instruction files for AI coding agents.

## contents

- `AGENTS.modern.md`: A strict template enforcing a specific, modern tech stack (Bun, TanStack Start, Vitest, Convex, UV, Mise) and the use of `context7` for documentation.
- `AGENTS.generic.md`: A flexible template for environments where the stack is not customizable, relying on standard web search for documentation.

Both templates strongly emphasize:
- Minimal, self-documenting code (no comments).
- Trusting the user's expertise.
- Proactive research of unknown concepts.
